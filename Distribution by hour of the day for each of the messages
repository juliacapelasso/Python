//  Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages. 
You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then splitting the string a second time using a colon.

Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, sorted by hour as shown below.
//

handle = open("mbox-short.txt")
counts = dict()
lst = list()
count = 0

#Splitting each line of the file to get words, 
#then word at 6th place, then in that first letter
#of that 6th word splitted by ':', appending that into the list

for line in handle:
    if line.startswith("From "):
        words = line.rstrip().split()
        words = words[5]
        words = words.split(':')
        lst.append(words[0])
                
#Now counting the letters occurred at different no. of times        

for i in lst:
    counts[i] = counts.get(i,0) + 1
        
#Finally sorting them by key(here time)

for k, v in sorted(counts.items()):
    print(k,v)
